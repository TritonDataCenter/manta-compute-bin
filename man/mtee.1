.TH mtee 1 "May 2013" Manta "Manta Compute Bin"
.SH NAME
.PP
mtee \- capture stdin and write to both stdout and a Manta object.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCmtee\fR [\-c durability] [\-H header: value ...] [manta object]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCmtee\fR is like \fB\fCmput\fR, but takes input on stdin instead of a file, and emits its
input on stdout as well, much like 
.BR tee (1).
.PP
\fB\fCmtee\fR is also similar to \fB\fCmpipe\fR, except that the newly created object does
\fInot\fP become an output object for the current task, and using mtee does not
prevent stdout from being captured.
.PP
For example, this will capture the output of cmd to manta object
\fB\fC/$MANTA_USER/stor/tee.out\fR and still pipe what was coming from cmd to cmd2:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ cmd | mtee /$MANTA_USER/stor/tee.out | cmd2
.fi
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP

$ mtee /$MANTA_USER/stor/tee.out
$ mtee -H 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' /$MANTA_USER/stor/tee.out
$ mtee -c 1 /$MANTA_USER/stor/tee.out
.fi
.RE
